I'm bad at Custom Views, so I'm learning reading from https://github.com/ZieIony/GuideToCustomViews

## I added:
 - 100% Kotlin
 - Some Kotlin [delegates](https://github.com/dcampogiani/CustomViews/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/danielecampogiani/customviews/delegates)
 - Material Components [Auto-Theming](https://github.com/dcampogiani/CustomViews/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/danielecampogiani/customviews/ChartView.kt#L122) (with [dark](https://github.com/dcampogiani/CustomViews/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml#L3) theme support)
 - Some [animation](https://github.com/dcampogiani/CustomViews/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/danielecampogiani/customviews/ChartView.kt#L131)
